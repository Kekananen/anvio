        A reaction a map are defined by one or more KOs. The presence/absence of any of these KOs
        in the contigs database translates to the presence/absence of the reaction. A KO can
        annotate one or more sequences in a contigs database.

        In global and overview maps, reaction lines are colored. In standard maps, reaction boxes or
        lines are colored.

        Parameters
        ==========
        contigs_dbs : Iterable[str]
            File paths to contigs databases containing KO annotations. Databases should have
            different project names, by which they are uniquely identified.

        output_dir : str
            Path to the output directory in which pathway map PDF files are drawn. The directory is
            created if it does not exist.

        groups_txt : str, None
            A tab-delimited text file specifying which group each contigs database belongs to. The
            first column must have the header, 'contigs_db', and the second column must have the
            header, 'group'. Items in the first column must be the file paths or project names of
            contigs databases. The second column contains group names, which are recommended to be
            single words without fancy characters, such as 'HIGH_TEMPERATURE' or 'LOW_FITNESS'
            rather than 'my group #1' or 'IS-THIS-OK?'. Each contigs database can only be associated
            with a single group. The 'group_threshold' argument must also be used for the groups to
            take effect, assigning colors based on group membership and drawing individual files
            ('draw_individual_files') and map grids ('draw_grid') for groups rather than individual
            databases.

        group_threshold : float, None
            The proportion of contigs databases in a group containing data of interest for the group
            to be represented in terms of presence/absence in a map feature. Here is a concrete
            example. Say each contigs database represents a genome, and the 'groups_txt' argument,
            which must be used with this argument, groups these genomes by their species, 'A', 'B',
            and 'C'. You wish to understand the distribution of metabolic capabilities across the 3
            species from KO annotations of genes. Reaction colors are assigned based on the groups
            rather than individual genomic contigs databases containing the reaction. Thresholds
            between 0 and 1 can be set to define group membership: a threshold of 0.0 would mean
            that ANY genome in the group can contain the KO for the KO to be considered present in
            the group; a threshold of 0.75 means at least 75% of the genomes in the group must
            contain the KO for it to be present; a threshold of 1.0 means that ALL genomes in the
            group must contain the KO for it to be present. In our example, set the threshold to
            0.5. Reaction J on a map corresponds to KO X, and Reaction K on a map corresponds to KO
            Y. 90% of species A genomes, 50% of species B genomes, and 10% of species C genomes
            contain KO X, so Reaction J would be colored to indicate that it is represented in
            species A and B. 0% of species A genomes, 15% of species B genomes, and 40% of species C
            genomes contain KO Y, so Reaction K would not be colored.

        pathway_numbers : Iterable[str], None
            Regex patterns to match the ID numbers of the drawn pathway maps. The default of None
            draws all available pathway maps in the KEGG data directory.

        draw_individual_files : Union[Iterable[str], bool], False
            First consider the case where groups are not defined by 'groups-txt'. If the
            '--draw-individual-files' argument is not False, draw map files for individual contigs
            databases. If True, draw maps for all of the contigs databases. Alternatively, the
            argument can accept the project names of a subset of contigs databases to only draw maps
            for those.

            Consider the case where groups are defined by 'groups-txt'. If the
            '--draw-individual-files' argument is not False, draw unified map files for individual
            groups showing membership of reactions in the contigs databases defining the group. If
            True, draw maps for all of the groups. Alternatively, the argument can accept a subset
            of group names to only draw maps for those. Maps are always colored by contigs database
            count, never explicitly by membership, allowing the comparison of maps for different
            groups in terms of the same colors.

        draw_grid : Union[Iterable[str], bool], False
            First consider the case where groups are not defined by 'groups-txt'. If the
            '--draw-grid' argument is not False, draw a paneled grid file for each pathway map
            showing the unified map of input contigs databases alongside maps for individual contigs
            databases. If True, include all of the contigs databases in the grid. Alternatively, the
            argument can accept the project names of a subset of contigs databases to only draw
            individual maps in the grid for those.

            Consider the case where groups are defined by 'groups-txt'. If the '--draw-grid'
            argument is not False, draw a paneled grid file for each pathway map showing the unified
            map of groups alongside maps for individual groups that display the membership of
            reactions among the contigs databases of the group. If True, include all of the groups
            in the grid. Alternatively, the argument can accept a subset of group names to only draw
            individual maps in the grid for those. Individual maps are always colored by contigs
            database count, never explicitly by membership, allowing the comparison of maps for
            different groups in terms of the same colors.

        colormap : Union[bool, str, matplotlib.colors.Colormap], True
            Reactions are dynamically colored to reflect the contigs databases (or groups of
            databases) involving the reaction, unless the argument value is False. False overrides
            dynamic coloring via a colormap with the argument provided to 'color_hexcode', so that
            reactions represented by KOs in contigs databases are assigned predetermined colors.

            The default argument value of True automatically assigns a colormap given the colormap
            scheme (see the 'colormap_scheme' argument). The scheme, 'by_count', uses by default the
            sequential colormap, 'plasma_r', which spans yellow (fewer databases or groups) to
            blue-violet (more databases or groups). This accentuates reactions that are shared
            rather than unshared across databases. In contrast, a colormap spanning dark to light,
            such as 'plasma', is better for drawing attention to unshared reactions. The scheme,
            'by_membership', uses by default the qualitative colormap, 'tab10'; it contains distinct
            colors suitable for clearly differentiating the different databases or groups containing
            reactions.

            The name of a Matplotlib Colormap or a Colormap object itself can also be provided to be
            used in lieu of the default. See the following webpage for named colormaps:
            https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html#classes-of-colormaps

        colormap_limits : Tuple[float, float], None
            Limit the fraction of the colormap used in dynamically selecting colors. The first value
            is the lower cutoff and the second value is the upper cutoff, e.g., (0.2, 0.9) limits
            color selection to 70% of the colormap, trimming the bottom 20% and top 10%. By default,
            for the colormap scheme, 'by_count', the colormap is 'plasma_r', and the limits are set
            to (0.1, 0.9). By default, for the scheme, 'by_membership', the colormap is
            qualititative ('tab10'), and limits are set to (0.0, 1.0).

        colormap_scheme : Literal['by_count', 'by_membership'], None
            There are two ways of dynamically coloring reactions by inclusion in contigs databases
            or groups of databases: by count, or explicitly by database/group or combination of
            databases/groups. Given the default argument value of None, with 4 or more
            databases/groups, reactions are colored by count, and with 2 or 3, explicitly by
            membership. In coloring by count, the colormap should be sequential, such that the color
            of a reaction changes 'smoothly' with the count. In contrast, coloring by database/group
            means reaction color is determined by membership in a database/group or combination of
            databases/groups, so a qualitative colormap can be suitable for clearly differentiating
            each.

        reverse_overlay : bool, False
            By default, with False, reactions in more contigs databases or groups of databases are
            drawn on top of those in fewer databases/groups. With True, the opposite applies;
            especially in global maps with a non-default colormap spanning dark to light, this
            accentuates unshared rather than shared parts of a pathway.

        color_hexcode : str, '#2ca02c'
            This is the color, by default green, for reactions containing contigs database KOs.
            Alternatively to a color hex code, the string, 'original', can be provided to use the
            original color scheme of the reference map. The 'colormap' argument must be False for
            this argument to be used, overriding dynamic coloring based on database/group membership
            with static coloring based on presence/absence in any database.

        colorbar : bool, True
            If True and coloring by database/group membership, save a colorbar legend to the file,
            'colorbar.pdf', in the output directory.

        draw_maps_lacking_kos : bool, False
            If False, by default, only draw maps containing any of the select KOs. If True, draw
            maps regardless, meaning that nothing may be colored.

        Returns
        =======
        Dict[Literal['unified', 'individual', 'grid'], Dict]
            Keys in the outer dictionary are different types of files that can be drawn. 'unified'
            maps show data from all contigs databases or groups of databases. 'individual' maps show
            data from individual databases or groups. 'grid' images show both unified and individual
            maps. 'unified' and 'grid' values are Dict[str, bool], where keys are pathway numbers,
            and values are True if the map was drawn, False if the map was not drawn because it did
            not contain any of the select KOs and 'draw_maps_lacking_kos' was False. 'individual'
            values are Dict[str, Dict[str, bool]], where keys in the outer dictionary are contigs
            database project names or group names, keys in the inner dictionary are pathway numbers,
            and values in the inner dictionary are True if the map was drawn, False if the map was
            not drawn because it did not contain any of the select KOs and 'draw_maps_lacking_kos'
            was False.

        Draw pathway maps, highlighting consensus KOs from the pan database.

        A reaction on a map can correspond to one or more KOs, and a KO can annotate one or more
        gene clusters. In global and overview maps, reaction lines are colored. In standard maps,
        reaction boxes or lines are colored.

        Parameters
        ==========
        pan_db : str
            File path to a pangenomic database. If a reaction network was stored in the database,
            then consensus KOs are determined using the consensus_threshold and discard_ties
            parameters stored as database metadata unless explicitly given here as arguments. These
            parameters are only stored in the database when a reaction network is stored.

        genomes_storage_db : str
            Path to the genomes storage database associated with the pan database. This contains
            KO annotations.

        output_dir : str
            Path to the output directory in which pathway map PDF files are drawn. The directory is
            created if it does not exist.

        pathway_numbers : Iterable[str], None
            Regex patterns to match the ID numbers of the drawn pathway maps. The default of None
            draws all available pathway maps in the KEGG data directory.

        draw_genome_files : Union[Iterable[str], bool], False
            Draw pathway maps for genomes of the pangenome if not False. If True, draw maps for all
            of the genomes. Alternatively, the names of a subset of genomes can be provided.

        draw_grid : Union[Iterable[str], bool], False
            If not False, draw a grid for each pathway map showing both the pangenomic map and a map
            for each genome of the pangenome, facilitating identification of the genomes containing
            reactions highlighted in the pangenomic map. If True, include all of the genomes in the
            grid. Alternatively, the names of a subset of genomes can be provided.

        colormap : Union[str, matplotlib.colors.Colormap, None], 'plasma_r'
            Reactions are dynamically colored to reflect the number of genomes involving the
            reaction, unless the argument value is None. None overrides dynamic coloring via a
            colormap using the argument provided to 'color_hexcode', so that reactions in the
            pangenome are assigned predetermined colors.

            Here is how a reaction is assigned a genome count. A reaction element in a map can
            contain one or more KOs. Find corresponding consensus KOs from the anvi'o pangenomic
            database. Each consensus KO is assigned to one or more gene clusters. Counted genomes
            have one or more genes in gene clusters with these consensus KOs.

            This argument can take either be the name of a built-in matplotlib colormap or a
            Colormap object itself. The default sequential colormap, 'plasma_r', spans yellow (fewer
            genomes) to blue-violet (more genomes). This accentuates reactions that are shared
            rather than unshared across genomes. A colormap spanning dark (fewer genomes) to light
            (more genomes), such as 'plasma', is better for drawing attention to unshared reactions.

            See the following webpage for named colormaps:
            https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html#classes-of-colormaps

        colormap_limits : Tuple[float, float], (0.0, 1.0)
            Limit the fraction of the colormap used in dynamically selecting colors. The first value
            is the lower cutoff and the second value is the upper cutoff, e.g., (0.2, 0.9) limits
            color selection to 70% of the colormap, trimming the bottom 20% and top 10%. The default
            limits with the default colormap scheme, 'plasma_r', are set to (0.1, 0.9).

        reverse_overlay : bool, False
            By default, with False, reactions in more genomes are drawn on top of those in fewer
            genomes. With True, the opposite applies; especially in global maps with a non-default
            colormap spanning dark to light, this accentuates unshared rather than shared parts of a
            pathway.

        color_hexcode : str, '#2ca02c'
            This is the color, by default green, for reactions containing consensus KOs from the pan
            database. Alternatively to a color hex code, the string, 'original', can be provided to
            use the original color scheme of the reference map. The 'colormap' argument must be
            False for this argument to be used, overriding dynamic coloring based on quantitative
            data with static coloring based on presence/absence in the pangenome.

        colorbar : bool, True
            If True and coloring by number of genomes, save a colorbar legend to the file,
            'colorbar.pdf', in the output directory.

        draw_maps_lacking_kos : bool, False
            If False, by default, only draw maps containing any of the select KOs. If True, draw
            maps regardless, meaning that nothing may be colored.

        consensus_threshold : float, None
            With a value of None, if a reaction network was stored in the pan database, then the
            consensus_threshold metavalue that was also stored in the database is used to find
            consensus KOs. If a reaction network was not stored, then with a value of None, the KO
            annotation most frequent in a gene cluster is assigned to the cluster itself. If a
            numerical value is provided (must be on [0, 1]), at least this proportion of genes in
            the cluster must have the most frequent annotation for the cluster to be annotated.

        discard_ties : bool, None
            With a value of None, if a reaction network was stored in the pan database, then the
            discard_ties metavalue that was also stored in the database is used to find consensus
            KOs. If a reaction network was not stored, then with a value of None, discard_ties
            assumes a value of False. A value of True means that if multiple KO annotations are most
            frequent among genes in a cluster, then a consensus KO is not assigned to the cluster
            itself, whereas a value of False would cause one of the most frequent KOs to be
            arbitrarily chosen.

        Returns
        =======
        Dict[Literal['unified', 'individual', 'grid'], Dict]
            Keys in the outer dictionary are different types of files that can be drawn. 'unified'

            Dict[str, bool], where keys are pathway numbers, and values are True if the map was
            drawn, False if the map was not drawn because it did not contain any of the select KOs
            and 'draw_maps_lacking_kos' was False. 'individual' values are Dict[str, Dict[str,

            dictionary are pathway numbers, and values in the inner dictionary are True if the map
            was drawn, False if the map was not drawn because it did not contain any of the select
            KOs and 'draw_maps_lacking_kos' was False.

        ==========
        ko_ids : Iterable[str]
            KO IDs to be highlighted in the maps.

        output_dir : str
            Path to the output directory in which pathway map PDF files are drawn. The directory is

            Regex patterns to match the ID numbers of the drawn pathway maps. The default of None
            draws all available pathway maps in the KEGG data directory.

        color_hexcode : str, '#2ca02c'
